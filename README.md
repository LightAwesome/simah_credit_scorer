# Simah Credit Scorer

A comprehensive credit scoring application that analyzes credit reports using AI-powered calculations. The system extracts data from PDF credit reports and applies sophisticated scoring algorithms to provide detailed credit analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- **PDF Credit Report Analysis**: Upload and extract data from credit report PDFs
- **AI-Powered Scoring**: Uses Claude Sonnet 3.5 for intelligent credit score calculations
- **Sectioned Scoring**: Breaks down credit scores into multiple categories (Traditional Score, Income & Employment, Alternative Data, Demographics, Vehicle Factors)
- **Interactive Configuration**: Web-based interface to configure scoring formulas and variables
- **Real-time Results**: Instant credit score analysis with detailed breakdowns
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface built with React

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application consists of two main components:

- **Backend**: FastAPI-based REST API with AI-powered calculation engine
- **Frontend**: React-based web interface for file upload and results display

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized setup)
- Python 3.8+ (for local backend setup)

### Key Endpoints

- `POST /api/upload` - Upload and analyze credit report PDFs
- `GET /api/calculations/formula` - Get current scoring configuration
- `PUT /api/calculations/formula` - Update scoring configuration
- `GET /api/calculations/variables` - Get available variables
- `PUT /api/calculations/variables` - Update variables

### Main Functions

- **PDF Extraction**: Extracts structured data from credit report PDFs using PyMuPDF and Camelot

- **Configuration Management**: Handles scoring formulas and variable definitions with JSON storage

### Scoring System

The application uses a multi-section scoring approach:

1. **Traditional Score (35% weight)**
   - SIMAH Score calculation
   - Credit History analysis
   - Payment History evaluation

2. **Income & Employment (30% weight)**
   - Income Level assessment
   - Employment Stability
   - Employer Type classification
   - DTI Ratio calculation

3. **Alternative Data (20% weight)**
   - Bank Account Age
   - Average Monthly Balance
   - Regular Salary Deposits
   - Savings Ratio
   - Overdrafts analysis

4. **Demographics (15% weight)**
   - Age Factor
   - Marital and Dependents
   - Geographical Stability
